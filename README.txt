MyHomeApp - Simple Launcher (ready-to-import)

What you get:
- Android Studio project in folder 'MyHomeApp_project'
- Package: com.example.myhomeapp
- Home screen shows a static background image.
- Swipe/scroll UP on home image to reveal app menu (4 apps per row).
- Swipe/scroll DOWN to hide app menu (returns to full-screen image).

How to open:
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open Android Studio -> Open an existing project -> select the project folder.
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle (you may need to install/update SDK/Gradle tools).
4. Run on a device. Set this app as the default Home launcher when prompted.

Notes:
- I could not build the APK in this environment. You can build an APK from Android Studio: Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s).
- If you want a different background image or grid size, tell me and I will update the project and provide a new ZIP.
